                <p>Front End Developers are computer programmers who specialize in website design. Front End Developer duties
                    include determining the structure and design of web pages, striking a balance between functional and
                    aesthetic design, and ensuring web design is optimized for smartphones. Front End developers often
                    collaborate with UI/UX to ensure all elements of the design are user friendly and are accessible to all
                    users. Front End developers are responsible for managing the data that gets sent from the backend to the
                    front end and must maintain cohesion between what data is received and how it is presented.
